Bad:
I really can't complain too much about this book. I've been professionally developing software for quite some time and still learned a lot from it. My few complaints: I found the chapter on resource management to be weak. Not only are there better ways to do this (visitor pattern), but it glosses over streaming large files.

I give this book 4 stars because I think for a novice to intermediate game programmer, you just can't get much better. But as a more seasoned programmer, you might find yourself wanting more information about threading, patterns, and resource management.

4.0 out of 5 starsFills a void on your game programming bookshelf
By Patrick Rouse on January 16, 2012
Format: Paperback Verified Purchase
Many books exist that attempt to teach 3D programming, a specific API or engine or try to demonstrate an entire engine being developed from start to finish. Unfortunately, many of these books fail in their attempt to bring these subjects the attention they deserve. The "write your own engine" books are the worst offenders due to their lack of emphasis on the non-renderer portions of the engine. While the renderer is undeniably the sexiest topic, too little attention on the other systems tend to leave these books falling well short of their intended goal. While Game Coding Complete is not strictly an engine design and programming book, it focuses on many engine components that other books fall well short of addressing.

Gaming Coding Complete attempts to bridge the gap between your 3D API books and a well formed engine. McShaffry's book takes the opposite approach of most other books by moving quickly through the 3D chapters and concentrates on other engine systems that are frequently underdeveloped or ignored completely. The rendering chapters comprise only about 100 pages and if you wish to learn DirectX, OpenGL or general rendering theory this is not the book for you. Most of the books is dedicated to other engine systems such as caching, user input, event management and developing a robust scripting engine using Lua. Other chapters that are a bit more introductory include discussions of collison and physics, networking, multi-threading, AI and even a simple level editor written in C#. A simple game near the end of the book wraps up the previous chapters in an effort to utilize all of your previous work.

The book strives to explain how to design engine systems in a way that makes your engine maintainable and reusable. Great attention in paid to decoupling the engine components so that each system is not dependent on including the headers for every other system in order to function. In McShaffry's code, everything operates on it's own with only interface classes and message queues to communicate with other engine components. Whether you agree with the design pattern will be a matter of personal taste and experience, but it is well developed for fans of the design.

Unfortunately, while a great deal of attention has been payed to the design, many sections suffer from a lack of thorough explanation. The author assumes a working knowledge of C++ and a bit of DirectX, both of which make perfect sense, but the book tends to skip many details assuming a level of knowledge that is a bit high for a book of it's type. It is not strictly a length issue as the book is quite long at around 900 pages, but with so many topics to cover many details are skipped outright. In some chapters, the lack of thorough explanation is completely understandable. Physics, AI, network programming and writing code for multi-core processors are deserving of entire books (and many exist for all), but several of the other chapters provide less material than it seems should be available. The audio and user interface chapters seem rushed at best and fail to discuss many important topics in both. The worst offender is the complete lack of scene management in the 3D chapters. For a book that seems to pride itself on developing engine systems that are often ignored, there is no discussion of techniques and algorithms to manage large 3D scenes outside of the most basic frustum culling. Even a cursory introduction to a relatively simple BSP or portal algorithm would have been welcome. The chapter on the caching system does mention techniques to minimize performance hits for loading new level geometry and texture data, but the lack of discussion of methods to slice up your levels into manageable chunks leaves the chapters feeling a bit empty.

Gaming Coding Complete is a fine book that serves as a good introduction to under discussed topics. The "Complete" moniker is debatable, but given the volume of topics to be covered, it seems somewhat callous to suggest that it is false advertising. Nevertheless, the books seems to demand another couple of chapters and a bit more explanation of material covered with a lack of detail. It is clear the author is quite knowledgeable and the book is considerably better than many books that are dedicated to engine design. With the impending release of the fourth edition, perhaps Game Coding Complete can overcome its few flaws and deliver and even better book.
