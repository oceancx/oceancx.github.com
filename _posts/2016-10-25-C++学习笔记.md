	1. member-wise copy: copy all members 
	2. customized copy-ctor & copy-assignment

OO: maintain internal state -> invariant 

value-semantics V.S reference-semantics


value-semantics: obj 

reference-semantic: obj1 replace obj2

rule of three.

RAII (Resource Acquirsition Is Intialization): pack resource inside a stack object.

GC drawbacks:
1. system resource pressure
2. undertrminesitc
3. memory resource

RVO ()

non-copyable

movable types: right-value objects

std::move() --> T&& rvalue reference -> rvalue --> trigger move-sematnics
